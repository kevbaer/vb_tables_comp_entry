For the past few years, I've been working on analyzing college volleyball data. In volleyball, there are six core skills: Serve, Receive, Attack, Block, Set, and Dig. Each of the positions uses those skills at a different rate. This table allows for quick and accurate analysis of the skillset and performance of volleyball players. 

The blue-to-white "PPA" columns represent a raw success score for that skill, with positive scores benefitting the player's team. The green-to-purple "%" columns represent the percentile for that PPA score for that skill and position. 

In the gold sections, each position has its own unique combination of skills required. For example, the outside hitter position is approximately 19% Serve, 25% Receive, 36% Attack, 12% Block, 10% Dig. This equals the "Weighted PPA" column and the "%" next to it. 

One drawback of using percentiles as a performance metric is that it hides the distribution of the population. By adding the distribution plots, that context is provided, allowing for a more accurate understanding and interpretation. One other neat feature is that each position is actually its own gt table to allow for the correct color coding and specific feature interpretations.

I believe this table packs a lot of information and function while still being attractive and simple. Of course, as always, I'm interested in feedback from others!
